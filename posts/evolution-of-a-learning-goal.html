<html><body><p>I just got back from the Lilly <a href="http://celt.miamioh.edu/lillycon/schedule.php?date=2014-11-20&amp;year=2014" title="Lilly International Conference on College Teaching">Conference</a> on College Teaching. The first workshop I went to was on course design. One chunk of this was on learning goals. This came in the second half of the workshop, after we’d talked quite a bit about learning factors, etc. I chose to work on my 200-level <a href="https://github.com/mglerner/IntroToBiophysics" title="Introduction to Biophysics">Biophysics</a> class, where I thought I had decent goals already. One of the ones I particularly liked was</p>
<blockquote><p>Use simple physical models to provide quantitative insight into biological systems.</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://sty.presswarehouse.com/Books/BookDetail.aspx?productID=323200">people running the workshop</a> have some good reasons for insisting on particular phrasing, and they recommend either “students will be able to [verb] [object]” or “given [thing] students will be able to [other thing].” Fair enough, if I lighten up a bit on the need for an action verb, I get</p>
<blockquote><p>Students will be able to use simple physical models to provide quantitative insight into biological systems.</p></blockquote>
<p>We talked a bit about how many goals a class should have. Their book recommends 3-5. If you have a ton more than that, you’re listing specific objectives rather than overarching goals. One of the authors/instructors actually recommends a single goal. If you can do it, it gives you a really nice way to focus the class, makes you comfortable cutting material in the interest of deep(er) learning, etc. The danger, of course, is that you don’t want a goal that’s general enough as to be meaningless.</p>
<p>We also talked about the time-frame of a goal. If you’re setting a 5-year goal (i.e. what do you want them to be like in 5 years), they have 5 years between now and the goal, so you don’t get to take credit (or responsibility) for the whole goal; you just need to plant a seed.</p>
<p>In thinking more about the class and about attitudes, it became clear that I really wanted the students to be able to identify a problem and play with it.</p>
<blockquote>Students will be able to identify a biological problem and play with it, using simple physical models to provide quantitative insight.</blockquote>
<p>At this point, we talked a bit more about the purpose of goals, and the idea that you want the class to be committed to the goals, and I was introduced to what may be my new favorite <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chicken_and_the_Pig" title="The Chicken and the Pig">fable</a>/punchline: “in a ham and egg breakfast, the chickin is involved; the pig is committed.”</p>
<p>Anyway, the above goal is sounding wordy, and is really trying to do too much at once. Worse, “play with it” is <em>maybe</em> clear to the instructor, but really unlikely to be clear to the students. There are at least two things going on here, and they’re worth separating: I’ll have to teach them as separate skills, students will certainly learn them as separate skills, and I should be explicit.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Given an identified biological problem, students will be able to identify several categories of physical models with which the problem might be addressed.</li>
<li>Given a biological problem and a physical model, students will be able to provide quantitative insight into the system.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point, it’s close, but there’s a bit more work to be done with categorizing the physical model(s). I mean, the students aren’t going to be dropping in an extraordinarily complex set of models for a 200-level class that requires only a semester of calc-based mechanics as a pre-req:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Given a biological system and an appropriate simple physical model, students will be able to adapt the model to the system, providing quantitative insight.</li>
<li>Given a biological problem, students will be able to identify several [candidate? potential?] physical models to apply to the system.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea of “adapting the model to the system” was an important addition, and a clarification of “play with.” It’s also something that I expect most students to have relatively little experience with, especially in an interdisciplinary context! In addition to a few other things, this was where I started monkeying with the “quantitative insight” wording, and where to put it in the goal.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Given a biological system, students will be able to name the appropriate physical models that apply.</li>
<li>Given a biological system, take a physical model and appropriately adapt it through quantitative analysis to that specific system.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>tweak a bit</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Given a biological system and a physical model, students will be able to appropriately adapt the model to the system to provide quantitative [insight?] analysis.</li>
<li>Given a biological system, students will be able to name appropriate physical models.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s pretty close. My penultimate version was a combination of the last few.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Given a biological system and a physical model, students will be able to adapt the model to the system through quantitative analysis.</li>
<li>Given a biological system, students will be able to name relevant physical models.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>“… be able to name …” doesn’t sound so strong, even though “relevant” carries a lot of weight. After looking at Bloom’s Taxonomy of Educational Objectives, a simple switch from “name” to “predict” captures what I want, and makes the goal much higher-level. I’ve added the third (and final) goal here:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Given a biological system and a physical model, students will be able to adapt the model to the system through quantitative analysis.</li>
<li>Given a biological system, students will be able to predict relevant physical models.</li>
<li>Students will gain exposure to important questions in the modern field of molecular biophysics, and evaluate current research on a system of their choice.
</li></ul>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s <em>much</em> better, both for me and the students! And that’s despite the fact that my original goal (“use simple physical models to provide quantitative insight into biological systems”) still sounds decent. I wonder if I should use that phrasing, and perhaps something about “play with a model” in the course description rather than the goals.</p>
